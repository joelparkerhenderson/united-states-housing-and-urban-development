This repository has U.S. HUD HMIS files that our team uses for a project. 

This is not a U.S. HUD official repository.

Files:

  * HUD HMIS XML Schema Definition (XSD) specification. 
  
  * HUD HMIS SQL file that is our team's conversion of the XSD file. 
  
  * A simple script that converts the HUD HMIS XSD file from XML to SQL.


The HUD HMIS XSD file is provided by https://github.com/hmis-interop/xml. 

For more info about HMIS and its specifications, see https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/hmis/ and http://www.hudhdx.info/VendorResources.aspx.
